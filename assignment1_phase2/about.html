              <b>Kerala</b> is a state on the southwestern Malabar Coast of
              India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, by combining Malayalam-speaking
              regions of the states of Travancore-Cochin and Madras.

            <p>
              Many temples in Kerala hold festivals on specific days of
              the year. A common characteristic of these festivals is the
              hoisting of a holy flag which is brought down on the final day of
              the festival after immersing the deity. Some festivals include
              Poorams, the best known of these being the <b>Thrissur Pooram</b>.
              "Elephants, firework displays and huge crowds" are the major
              attractions of Thrissur Pooram. Other known festivals are
              <b>Makaravilakku, Chinakkathoor Pooram, Attukal Pongala and Nenmara
              Vallangi Vela</b>.

              By the 21st century, almost all the native sports and games
              from Kerala either disappeared or became just an art form
              performed during local festivals; including Poorakkali, Padayani,
              Thalappandukali, Onathallu, Velakali, and
              Kilithattukali. However, Kalaripayattu, regarded as "the mother of
              all martial arts in the world", is an exception and is practised
              as the indigenous martial sport. Another traditional sport of
              Kerala is the boat race, especially the <b>race of Snake boats</b>.

              Kerala is home to a number of performance arts, which includes five
              classical dance forms: <b>Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattom,
              Thullal and Krishnanattam </b>, which originated and developed in the
              temple theatres during the classical period under the
              royal houses.Kerala natanam, Thirayattam,Theyyam,
              Koothu and Padayani are other dance forms associated with the
              temple culture.

            <p>
              The culture of Kerala is composite in nature and
              is an integral part of Indian culture. It is a synthesis of
              Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures, developed over
              millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad.
              It is defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity
              sustained by the <b>Malayali people</b>.

        Kerala's culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demographics,
        have made the state one of the most popular tourist destinations in
        India. In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named Kerala as
        one of the "ten paradises of the world" and "50 must see destinations of
        a lifetime". Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as "One of the 100
        great trips for the 21st century".</b>
